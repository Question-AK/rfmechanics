## Current seated listening palette (2026-09-07)

Run `python render_seated_oresong.py` to render and verify the current assets, or
`python render_seated_oresong.py --check` to verify without writing. `--only iron,nativecopper`
limits material selection. Requires Python, NumPy, SciPy and ffmpeg; no game samples.

Sixteen material voices have three deterministic variations and separate rough/clear
layers (96 mono OGGs), plus a knock and stone response. Voices last 4.2 seconds at
44.1kHz. Distinct attack rhythms, partial spacing, texture and decay identify materials;
grade crossfades rough/clear, size adds a restrained chorus, distance changes clarity.
Runtime pitch variation is only +/-1%. All outputs are original procedural synthesis.

The renderer verifies channel count, sample rate, decoded duration, finite samples and
peak headroom. Its RMS normalization keeps materials at comparable levels. Actual
perceived balance and directional readability still need the in-game playtest.

`render_oresong.py` below is the historical v1 renderer. It now writes OGGs under
`wav/legacy-v1/`, outside the shipped assets, so it cannot overwrite this palette.

## Historical v1 notes

Procedural synthesizer for the dwarf ore-song mechanic's sound assets. Renders
one mono `.ogg` per ore/gem material from a Python data table, with real
vanilla-game sound textures blended in as an extra layer per material.
These assets are used by RF Mechanics. Requires Python, NumPy, SciPy and ffmpeg.

## Run it

```
python render_oresong.py
```

Writes 16-bit WAVs to `wav/` (gitignored, intermediate) and the final mono
`.ogg` files to
`assets/rfmechanics/sounds/oresong/oresong-<material>.ogg`.

To retune a single material and re-encode only that file:

```
python render_oresong.py --only iron
python render_oresong.py --only iron,quartzgem
```

`--only` restricts which files get **written**, but every material is still
synthesized internally each run (cheap — pure numpy, no filesystem/ffmpeg
cost for the synthesis itself) so the group loudness normalization (see
below) always reflects the same 10-material reference, even on a
single-file retune. The vanilla-sample blend layer *is* decoded via ffmpeg
on every run for every material regardless of `--only`, since it feeds the
same normalization pass — still well under a second total.

## The MATERIALS table

`RAW_MATERIALS` in `render_oresong.py` is the editable surface — one
18-value tuple per material, columns defined in `COLUMNS`:

```
f0   inharm modes mallet formant  fq  dur  strike sustain jitter scatter ampvar beat grit grind grate noise trem
```

`build_material_spec()` turns each row into a `MaterialSpec` (partials,
envelope timing, layer amounts). Edit a tuple value, re-run, listen — no
need to touch the synthesis code for routine retuning.

| Column | Drives | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `f0` | Fundamental (Hz) | |
| `inharm` | Partial stretching | Piano-string-style coefficient: `ratio(n) = n·√(1 + B·n²)`, `B = inharm/20000`. Low = harmonic/musical (metals), high = glassy/detuned (quartzgem) |
| `modes` | Partial count | 1–16 partials generated per material |
| `mallet` | Transient brightness + spectral tilt | Harder mallet (higher value) → shorter/brighter impact click (`transient_ms`, `transient_band`) and flatter partial amplitude falloff (brighter sustain) |
| `formant` | Resonance peak (Hz) | A narrow bandpass boost applied to the full mix — an approximate "body resonance" emphasis, also glues the sample layer's color into the synthesized tone |
| `fq` | Shimmer/drift + spectral tilt | Drives slow frequency drift on partials n≥2 (generalizes the old quartzgem-only chirp) and contributes to brightness alongside `mallet` |
| `dur` | Total file length (s) | Includes the 1s tail fade |
| `strike` | `strike_decay_ms` | Length of the fast post-transient decay |
| `sustain` | `sustain_level` (%) | Where strike-decay bottoms out before the slower sustain-decay takes over |
| `jitter` | Per-partial detune spread | Static per-partial mistuning (chorus-like richness), amount = `jitter/15` Hz, seeded per material |
| `scatter` | Transient grain count/spread | Splits the impact into 1–4 randomly-offset noise grains instead of one clean click — rougher, less percussive attack at high values |
| `ampvar` | `tremolo_depth` | Slow amplitude wobble depth (the "hard to pinpoint" cue) |
| `beat` | Detuned fundamental pair | Adds a second partial at ratio 1.0 detuned by `beat/12` Hz — audible beating, generalizes the old sphalerite-only mechanism to every material |
| `grit` | Low rumble noise (80–450Hz) | `noise_body_amp` |
| `grind` | Mid-high grinding noise (800–2500Hz) | New layer; roughened by `grate` |
| `grate` | Grind-layer roughness | Fast amplitude modulation on the grind layer only, rate `20 + grate·8` Hz — distinct from the slow `trem` wobble on the whole mix |
| `noise` | High shimmer/hiss (2.5–6kHz) | `hf_amp` |
| `trem` | `tremolo_hz` | Rate of the slow whole-mix wobble |

Partials pushed above 12kHz by a high `inharm`/`modes` combination (mostly
quartzgem) are soft-rolled off rather than left at full amplitude, so
"stretched" doesn't become "painful."

## Real-sample blending (new this pass)

`SAMPLE_LAYERS` maps each material to a vanilla `assets/survival/sounds/`
file, resampled (naive pitch-shift-via-resample, same mechanism as the
quern-at-pitch-0.5 idea from the original brief) and mixed in alongside the
synthesized layers, then run through the same `formant` resonance boost so
it picks up the material's tonal color instead of sitting on top of it.
Two blend modes:

- **`"transient"`** — the sample is pitched, given a short fade in/out, and
  placed at t=0 as an extra, more "real" impact layer on top of the
  synthesized click/grain transient.
- **`"bed"`** — the sample is pitched, tiled to fill the sustain window, and
  shaped by the same envelope as the tonal body — used where the source
  clip itself has a long, ring-y decay worth keeping (the quern grind, the
  cathedral-bell decay).

| Material | Source | Pitch | Mode | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| galena | `block/quern.ogg` | 0.55 | bed | Original brief's own pick for galena; slowed further into a grinding-rock bed under the synth noise body |
| coal | `block/charcoal2.ogg` | 0.80 | transient | Crumbly break hit, deepened slightly |
| nativegold | `effect/deepbell.ogg` | 1.00 | bed | 7.2s stereo→mono resonant bell, almost exactly gold's 7s target — used near-native |
| nativesilver | `effect/deepbell.ogg` | 1.35 | bed | Same bell, pitched up for a brighter, silvery ring |
| nativecopper | `block/heavymetal-hit.ogg` | 0.90 | transient | Warm metal clang |
| sphalerite | `block/glass.ogg` | 1.10 | transient | Crystal shimmer to sit under the synthesized detuned-pair beating |
| cassiterite | `block/rock-hit-pickaxe.ogg` | 1.00 | transient | Dense mineral clunk |
| chromite | `block/rock-break-pickaxe.ogg` | 0.95 | transient | Denser, brittle-break character |
| iron | `block/anvil2.ogg` | 0.80 | transient | Literal anvil ring, deepened for weight |
| quartzgem | `walk/glass2.ogg` | 1.40 | transient | Bright glass tap on top of the stretched-partial shimmer |

These are a first-pass creative guess, explicitly meant to be experimented
with by ear — swap the `path`, `pitch`, `gain`, or `mode` for any material
and re-render with `--only <name>`. Other candidates worth trying from the
same asset tree: `block/anvil1.ogg`/`anvil3.ogg` (shorter/sharper anvil
hits), `block/heavymetal-hit2.ogg` (brighter metal), `block/loosestone1-4.ogg`
(looser rock clatter), `effect/stonecrush.ogg`, `walk/glass1.ogg`/`glass3.ogg`.

If a sample source moves or the game reinstalls elsewhere, this script
reads `VINTAGE_STORY` from the environment (same var documented in the
workspace's `CLAUDE.md`) and falls back to `C:\Games\Vintagestory`.

## Loudness hierarchy (group normalization, not per-file)

Files are **not** individually peak-normalized — that would erase the
loudness spread that falls naturally out of the table (galena/coal's high
`grit`/`grind`/`noise` values read as quiet-and-hard-to-place; low-noise
metals and the bright, high-`mallet` quartzgem read as present). Instead:
all 10 materials are rendered raw, the single loudest sample across all 10
is found, and one scale factor is computed so that peak lands at -3 dBFS.
Nothing else attenuates further — the hierarchy is entirely a product of
the table values now, not a separate manual dial.

## Playback design note

These files are pre-rendered and deterministic. Two simultaneous instances
of the same material (e.g. two copper veins firing at once) will be
phase-identical and comb-filter into sounding like a single source. The
ore-song design already plans random `SetPitch` jitter per played instance
for other reasons — but that jitter is now **load-bearing for
anti-comb-filtering**, not just cosmetic variation, and should be sized
(~±10%) with that in mind when it's integrated.
